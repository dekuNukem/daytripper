Thanks for purchasing Daytripper! Here is a short guide on how to put everything together.

If yours is already assembled, please move on to the [Quick Start Guide](/quick_start_guide.md).

## Recommended Tools

A pliers and a small Phillips-head screwdriver is recommended.

However this is perfectly doable with your bare hands, so don't sweat if you don't have the tools.

## Handling Bare Circuit Boards

You're going to handle a bare circuit board in this assembly, and there is a risk of electrostatic discharge, where the static electricity(SE) on your body discharges and damages the board. This is especially a concern during dry weather.

My suggestion is simply **wash your hands**, by doing so you release the existing SE through the metal water pipe, your hands are moist to prevent further SE build-up, and your clean hands won't leave greasy fingerprints all over the place, win-win-win!

Of course, your hands can't be dripping wet either, otherwise the water is going to damage the board.

## Assembly Steps

You should have the following components, keep a note of their names as I'm going to refer to them later.

First off peel off the protective film on the `Acrylic Front and Back plate`. 

Of course you don't have to do it if you like the unpeeled look.

Gather the `Acrylic Back Plate`, `4x M2 Standoffs 6mm`, and `4x M2 Screws 18mm`.

Thread the screw through the hole, then screw on the standoffs.

Do not overtighten the standoff! Doing so might crack the acrylic plate. Finger-tight is OK, just make sure it's not loose and doesn't rattle.

Wash your hands, grab the circuit board by its edge, and install the `TX board` as shown:

Screw on the `4x M2 Standoff 4mm`. Make sure to tighten.

Install the `Acrylic Front Plate` as shown.

Put on the nuts. Again don't overtighten. Might be easier with pilers.

Flip it over. Clean the backplate with a dry cloth if dirty.

Peel the metal plate from the white side to expose the adhesives.

Stick the metal plate to the back plate, preferably where the battery is. 

Peel off the blue protective film, and we're done!
