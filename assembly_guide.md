Thanks for purchasing Daytripper! Here is a short guide on how to put everything together.

If yours is already assembled, please move on to the [Quick Start Guide](/quick_start_guide.md).

## Recommended Tools

A pliers and a small phillips-head screwdriver is recommended.

However this is perfect doable with your bare hands, so don't sweat if you don't have the tools.

## Assembly Steps

You should have the following components, keep a note of their names as I'm going to refer to them later.

First off peel off the protective film on the `Acrylic Front and Back plate`. 

Of course you don't have to do it if you like the unpeeled look.

Gather the `Acrylic Back Plate`, `4x M2 Standoffs 6mm`, and `4x M2 Screws 18mm`

Thread the screw through the hole, then screw on the standoffs.

Do not overtighten the standoff! Doing so might crack the acrylic plate. Finger-tight is OK, just make sure it's not loose and doesn't rattle.

Install the TX board as shown:

Screw on the `4x M2 Standoff 4mm`. Make sure to tighten.

Install the `Acrylic Front Plate` as shown.

Put on the nuts. Again don't overtighten. Might be easier with pilers.

Roll it over, peel the metal plate from the white side to expose the adhesives.

Stick the metal plate to the back plate, preferably where the battery is. 

Peel off the blue protective film, and we're done!
